== Description ==

'Pages and Posts in Feed' is a simple plugin that modifies WordPress RSS feed to include both 'Page' and 'Post' types in the site's feed. This creates a site feed with both pages and blog posts in it. Useful for those who use WordPress as a CMS.

The plugin needs no configuration. Just activate it, and you are good to go. Deactivating the plugin restores RSS feeds to their default state.

= I just activated the plugin, why don't I see pages in my feed? =

If you're using Feedburner you'll have to wait until your updated feed is picked up by Feedburner. This isn't immediate so give it a few hours.

= How do I change number of items in feed? =

Number of page and post items in feed are controlled from 'Reading Settings' in WordPress dashboard.

= Where are the settings? =

There are no settings. Once the plugin is activated, all your new pages and posts are automatically included in the WordPress RSS feed.
